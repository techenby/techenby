- Alter style of posts
- Don't open posts that don't have more to show
- Show the different between posts that have more to show and those that don't
- Lightmode/Darkmode header images
- Manually upload an image to a link post
	- make external images smaller
	- if automatically grabbing image doesn't work
- Figure out why social icons don't work on mobile
- Update/add social icons
    - Maybe link to pinkary instead
    - Maybe add suggest.gg
- Update pupper icon (too dark, want to match vibe of other icons)
- Investigate using doodle icons from Envato
- Get Lighthouse score up
- Interactive "Uses" page?
- Link Obsidian?
- Do we really like the purple?
