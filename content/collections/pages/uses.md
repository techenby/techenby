## On my Computer

## For Making Stuff

- VSCode
- iTerm2 w/  Oh My Zsh
- TablePlus
- Firefox, Brave, Chrome, and Safari - I can't really pick which I like best
- Ray - helpful for debugging when I don't want to drop dd() everywhere
- Invoker - what I use for side projects instead of building an admin panel
- HELO - go-to app for testing emails
- Tower - my git gui of choice
- Transmit - some side clients prefer FTP, so this makes it easier
- Laravel Valet - so I don't have to bother with Docker
- DBngin - manages databases so I don't have to bother with Docker
- ImageOptim - minifys images so they're not HUGE
- Contrast - helps make sure the contrast of text/background is good
- PHP Monitor - easy php version switcher and lets you know which version you are on in the navbar

## For Everything Else

- 1Password
- Affinity Designer
- Alfred
- Minecraft
- Timeular - helps me keep track of what I'm working on when and keeps myself accountable

## Utilities

- Bartender - Keeps the menu bar neat and tidy
- Flux - I get migraines a lot, and it makes the color of my computer's display adapt to the time of day, warm at night and like sunlight during the day which helps reduce the number of my migraines (in addition to the blue light filter in my glasses)
- Itsycal - adds a Windows like calendar view to the menu bar
