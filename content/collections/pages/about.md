👋 Hey, Hi, Hello!

My name is Andy Newhouse, but I also go by TechEnby online. I use `they/them` pronouns. I’m a programmer at [Tighten](https://tighten.com), the Director of Technology for [SGD Institute](https://sgdinstitute.org) and help out my spouse with their small crafting business [Chaotic Notions](https://chaoticnotions.xyz). I'm neurodivergent and non-binary. 🏳️‍⚧️

I live in a suburb of Chicago, IL with my spouse Ash and our two dogs Velvet and Geo. I love spending free time building LEGO sets, binging various animated TV shows, babysitting our 3D printers, playing video games (mostly Pokémon, Mario Kart and Minecraft), blowing air into a Clarinet or Trumpet in my community band, leveling up my cooking and baking skills, or playing card and board games with friends.
