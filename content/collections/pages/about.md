👋 Hello,

My name is Andy Newhouse, but I also go by TechEnby online. I use `they/them` pronouns. I’m a Lead Programmer at [Tighten](https://tighten.com). I'm neurodivergent and non-binary. 🏳️‍⚧️

I live in a suburb of Chicago, IL with my spouse Ash and our two dogs Velvet and Geo. I love spending free time building LEGO sets, binging various animated TV shows, babysitting our 3D printers, playing video games (mostly Pokémon, Mario Kart and Minecraft), playing Clarinet, Guitar or Trumpet in [Lakeside Pride](https://lakesidepride.org/), leveling up my cooking and baking skills, or playing card and board games with friends.
