title: 'First Friction with Coverage and PHPStan'
caption: 'While building Sunny, I’ve been vaguely checking my code coverage and checking PHPstan and seeing what I’m “forced” to write to get to 100% coverage or to make stan happy. So far, everything it has found has been something I missed. I’ve encountered an instance where these tools encourage me to break my patterns. I probably wouldn’t have written a test for this without coverage or PHPstan.'
