caption: "I'm on a painting kick because I just finished this project a day after finishing the previous one. Years ago, I saw a painting in my favorite Chicago diner by [William F. Whiteside](https://chicagosocietyofartists.org/csa-member-exhibits/), and I recreated it with different colors for my office. I'm super happy with how it turned out!"
