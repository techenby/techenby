caption: 'One of my favorite recent shows is [The Owl House](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8050756/) created by Dana Terrace. It originally aired on Disney Channel, and I watched it on Disney+. I really like the idea of having subtle nerdy things as my backdrop during video calls, so I painted the Owl House from the show.'
