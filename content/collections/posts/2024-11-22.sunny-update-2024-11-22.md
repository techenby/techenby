        text: "There have been a few PRs this past month, and now that I’m streaming more of my work on Sunny, progress will be slower. Most of this month's work revolves around the “Log Pose” feature, a dashboard that lives under my primary monitor with the current time and weather, as well as my and Ashar’s calendars."

        text: 'Also, I deployed what I’ve done on Sunny to Forge. It’s on a Digital Ocean Droplet (2 vCPUs / 2GB / 60GB Disk) with everything I host (like this website). Since the cool kids use SQLite these days, I’m using that database driver. I had problems installing the app because I forgot to add Flux to the packages section, but once I remembered, the rest of the installation process was smooth.'

I’m only doing this for the “coworkers” tile since I didn’t want to leave that data committed to the repo. A nice bonus with this change is that it makes reordering folks easier, so folks I’m on a project with or working closely with are at the top.'
