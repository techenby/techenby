caption: "Today, I finished another [William F. Whiteside](https://chicagosocietyofartists.org/csa-member-exhibits/)- inspired art piece to fill in a hole on my office wall! It looks great from far away, but I am a bit more critical the closer I get. I need to remind myself that mistakes happen. I'm improving with each painting I do."
