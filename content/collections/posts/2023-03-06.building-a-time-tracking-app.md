For various reasons I'm dumping the time tracker I have been using, and building my own. Follow along on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@techenby).

I've already subbed out a initial version of the app, and have been using it to track my activities for over a week, but instead of recapping what I've done. I'm going to start over and build it with you.

Goals:
- Physical component
- Track what I'm doing when
- Easy to add integrations
- Not expensive 
- Add goals (i.e. X hours working)

App Tools:
- [Laravel](https://laravel.com/docs)
- [Livewire](https://laravel-livewire.com)
- [Filament](https://filamentphp.com)
- [FullCalendar](https://fullcalendar.io)
