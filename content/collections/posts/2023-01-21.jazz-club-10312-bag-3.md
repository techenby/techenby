caption: "Bag 3 âœ… In this bag I really enjoyed building the Double Bass case (bottom right attached to the bass player). I wish it could accommodate the actual instrument that he's holding but that would have made it a lot bigger. Also on the bass player, there is a hearing aid or monitor on the right side of the head which is a print I've never seen before!"
